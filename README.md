# data explorer app 

Created a very simple web app with `streamlit` to explore data related to articles interactions (from Kaggle). The data contains information gathered from facebook's API and shows the level of infteraction for different articles and different newspapers.

The app aims at helping the data analysis by enabling an easier data exploration.
