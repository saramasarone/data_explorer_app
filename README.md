# data explorer app 

Created a very simple web app with `streamlit` to explore data related to online articles interactions (dataset from Kaggle). The data contains information gathered from facebook's API and shows the level of interaction for different articles and different newspapers.

The app aims at helping the data analysis by enabling an easier data exploration.
